# Forces of Nature

A mobile match-three game for two players, built in Unity for Android.

## How to play

Forces of Nature is a board game in which two players take turns to place tiles on a 5x5 grid, aiming to get the most points by their placements.

Tiles are released in sets of three to the draft pool, and the first player can pick any of the three to place on the board. The second player picks from the remaining two, then player one has to place the final tile. For the next three tiles, player two will get to pick first.

The tiles have one of three symbols on them: flame, water, or flower. Placing tiles in the same row or column as a tile with the same symbol will gain the player points, and the closer the two tiles are, the more points you gain (+5, +3, +2, +1).

**HOWEVER**, placing a tile in the same row of column as a tile with a *different* symbol will lose points! The same scoring rules apply - directly adjacent is -5, then -3, -2, -1.

Additionally, placing 3 or more tiles of the same type next to each other will grant significant bonus points, and clear those tiles from the board. This adds an extra layer to the game, where players want to maximise their own points whilst making sure they aren't setting up their opponent for a big score on the next turn.

Players will play until either all 30 tiles are placed, or no more tiles can be placed on the board. Whoever has the highest score at the end of the game wins!
